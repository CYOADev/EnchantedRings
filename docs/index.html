<!--
For anyone wanting to contribute to this html page, here is the stuff that I have figured out.
Each row is in a <tr> tag, and each row has 8 columns, using <td> tags
Colspan in td controls how many columns it spans, and rowspan controls how many row it spans. In the <td> tag, the class 'parent' means that the option has a parent, the class 'child' means that the option has a child. The class 'child-left' and 'child-right' is when there's an edge not filled by a child.
<td> tags must start with a <span> tag, which have different classes for different amount of points.
a1 is add 1 point, a2 is add 2 points, all the way to 9 points
s1 is subtract 1 point, s2 is subtract 2 points, all the way to 9 points
Asking me on reddit (/u/SGVsbG8gV29ybGQK) is always recommended

					<h1>Enchante/d/ Rings CYOA</h1>
					<p>
						The goddess of all things lewd has granted you the power to craft magical rings. When worn, they will provide magical powers; but in exchange, they will carry some drawbacks for the entertainment of the goddess. You must craft all rings right now, but can read the whole document before doing anything.
					</p>
					<p>
						Each ring you make is very thin and easy to put on. However, some may only come off under certain conditions. By default, only you can wear the rings. If you lose them, you can make them come back to you. They cannot be destroyed.
					<p>
						If you take any drawback that involves permanent use of some other jewelry or equipment that is connected to the body, the ring may be shaped as the device itself.
					</p>
					<hr/>
					<p>
						For each ring, you can buy any amount of powers, drawbacks; in any order you want. Powers will take points, drawbacks will give you points. All points are specific to that ring, and the total sum of points of each ring must be zero or positive.
					</p>
					<p>
						The rings you make are crafted in order. The first one you craft starts with 0 points, the second one starts with -2 points, the third with -4 points, and so on. This does not apply to slave rings and rings of ownership.
					</p>
					<p>
						Some effects can’t be taken together: they can’t be applied to the same ring. They may be applied to different rings, but these rings cannot then be worn together. In general, two effects from two different rings count as taken together for as long as they’re both active if the two rings are worn together.
					</p>
					<p>
						Unless otherwise specified, each effect cannot be taken more than once per ring.
					</p>
					<p>
						Multiple rings can be worn together only if they have together at least as much unused points as the sum of their common drawbacks minus the sum of their common non-stackable powers; for example, if two rings have only three +3 drawbacks and a -5 non-stackable power in common, they must have together at least 4 left over points to be worn together. Their common powers and drawbacks don’t stack (except for powers that can be taken multiple times); drawbacks and punishments that override powers override them over all active powers, not just the powers from their own ring.
					<p>
						The goddess wants you to entertain her, so she will keep random events from happening at times that would put you in danger.
					</p>
					<hr/>
					<p>
						“The ring” or “this ring” refers to the ring on which the effect is applied.
					</p>
					<p>
						Choices written as “choose <em>now</em>” must be made when the ring is crafted. A different choice may be made each time an effect is applied on a ring. Choices written as “choose <em>upon activation</em>” must be made when the ring is put on.
					</p>
					<p>
						When a ring is put on, its drawbacks and punishments activate immediately, but <b>a ring's powers activate only after having being worn for a week</b> <em>(startup duration)</em>. Also, when the ring is taken off, its powers deactivate immediately, but <b>its drawbacks and punishments stay active for a full week after the ring is taken off</b> <em>(cooldown duration)</em>. The ring can be taken off during the startup duration, but its powers would not have been activated. The ring cannot be put back on until its cooldown duration has finished. This also applies to rings with the same drawback and other rings conflicting with this one.
					</p>
					<hr/>
					<p>
						Many elements will have a particular symbol in the upper left corner as a short hand for a more complicated issue or interactions.  Their meanings as follows:<br/>
						<img class="m_svg"/>/<img class="f_svg"/> indicates that the element requires a penis/vagina to take, this is not explicitly male or female sex (ie, a futanari/herm will satisfy both).<br/>
						<img class="u_svg"/> indicates that a drawback requires a consequent population to be around. <strong>Important</strong>: if you’re not in an urban area or live extremely reclusively while wearing a ring with such drawbacks, the powers will slowly fade (or new drawbacks will appear). They disappear completely after a few months, and take a few months (with the ring being worn) to come back.<br/>
						<img class="p_svg"/> indicates that a drawback uses the word <em>must</em>. <strong>Important</strong>: a punishment has to be selected for each such drawback.<br/>
						<img class="g_svg"/> indicates that a drawback may involve arbitrary people. By default, this will only include adults outside of your family. Some drawbacks and powers can affect who is involved.<br/>
						<img class="t_svg"/> indicates that the element is a transformation effect.  All transformation effects are physical/non-magic body changes.  For each that you have you may choose <em>now</em> the time they take to change between instant and one hour. <br/>
						<img class="w_svg"/> indicates that the element has a world building function, generating or modifying a world that is not your own.  Your actions are capable of altering these worlds for better or worse and no point cost is changed retroactively.  Your ability to change things may be limited in the text.<br/>
						For powers, ambiguous ideas within the power will tend to reflect your desires and negative changes you may impart on the world are likely to sort themselves out in time.  For punishments, ambiguous points will tend to reflect your doubts and fears and over time similar problems will reappear if you manage to solve one. <br/>
						Points from drawbacks and corruptions may fade if the associated world is avoided. <br/>
						<img class="s_svg"/> indicates that the element changes your social standing or social class.  Although you can effect this for better or worse, they will follow similar logic in restoring benefits of powers and problems of drawbacks as the world building ones.
						<br/>If you have access to other realities from powers on the same ring, social standing powers (and most corruptions and drawbacks) will function only in the world on that ring.  Points from drawbacks and corruptions that are world specific will fade if avoided, just like the world building ones.<br/>
						<img class="aa_svg"/>/<img class="as_svg"/> indicates that the element establishes an authority figure/grants an authority figure new powers.  An authority figure will never face social or legal backlash for their orders or control, society will ignore any obvious illegality or immorality. This functions as if the authority has both <strong>Move Along</strong> and <strong>Vanilla</strong>. For all drawbacks, the mentioned person(s) will be(include) an authority whenever possible.<br/>
						<img class="b_svg"/> indicates that the element causes alterations to your mind or personality.  This prevents you from resisting its effect as you will believe the behavior from it is your normal.  You will not be aware there is or was any such change while the ring is <em>activated</em>.<br/>
					</p>
					<hr/>
					<p>
						No power can be used to escape or avoid the effect of a drawback or punishment, and effects with obvious contradictions cannot be taken together. Some drawbacks may, directly or indirectly, cause you to be abused; in those cases, your abuser will generally try to take you somewhere at least a little private. A ring does not count as being worn if the wearer is dead. Finally, you are forced to have the following seven powers permanently for free.
					</p>
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="head"><span>Cured</span>
					At the time of the crafting, you are cured of all physical and mental sicknesses or disabilities that you choose <em>now</em> to be cured of.
				</td>
				<td class="head"><span>Relocated</span>
					At the time of the crafting, you are provided a home, very basic welfare income, and a blank criminal record in any city of any country on earth. You must choose that city <em>now</em>.
				</td>
				<td class="head"><span>Swapped gender</span>
					You permanently become, if you choose so <em>now</em>, an equivalent of the current you but of the opposite gender. If you do so, you may choose to mentally adopt the psychological gender-specific characteristics of taken gender if you want to. You are as fertile as a normal person of that gender. All those decisions must be made <em>now</em>.
				</td>
				<td class="head"><span>Safe drawbacks</span>
					All sexual intercourse that occurs as a direct or indirect result of one of the drawbacks, consensual or not, is guaranteed to be STD-free if you want it to be. Incurable STDs for the masses can be replaced entirely with infertility instead of death. It is spread the same way and birth/death rates are unchanged.
				</td>
				<td class="head"><span>Move along</span>
					You are guaranteed to never get in trouble with any kind of authority for any effect of a drawback. That aside, everyone still reacts as normal to what you’re doing.
				</td>

					You are guaranteed that all drawbacks that involve other people (marked with a <img class="g_svg"/>) will not involve any of your <em>family members</em>. Can be overridden by <strong>Incest</strong>.

					<em>During activation</em>, you are cured of any diseases you may have (unless you specifically don’t want to be cured of it), and you become immune to all diseases, poisons, venoms, radiation, and allergens until deactivation.
				</td>
				<td class="child"><span class="s7">Regeneration</span>
					<em>During activation</em>, you regenerate very rapidly any physical damage dealt to you. You will still feel the pain that damage would cause to you, though.
				</td>
				<td class="child"><span class="s3">Painless</span>
					You cannot feel physical pain unless you want to. You can also choose at any time what kinds of pain you want to feel.
				</td>
				<td class="child"><span class="s5">No Sustenance</span>
					<em>During activation</em>, you do not need any food, water or air to live, and you won’t thin down or feel hunger, thirst or asphyxiation no matter the case. You can still eat normally without any unusual effects.
				</td>
				<td><span class="s5">Teleport</span>

				</td>

				<td><span class="s5">Gifted</span>
					Choose <em>now</em> any subject, and you will become as competent as the most competent person in that specific subject currently is or has ever been. Can be taken multiple times on the same ring.
				</td>
				<td><span class="s5">Vanilla</span>
					Unless this is explicit goal of a drawback, people will find what you do normal and, while not doing it themselves, will not be shocked or revolted, or shame you for what the drawbacks cause you to do. They will still want to take advantage of you as much as before, however.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="parent" colspan="4"><span class="s9">Invulnerability</span>
					<em>During activation</em>, you will never die or feel discomfort unless you want to. You can choose at any time what kind of discomfort you want to feel, but if you manage to die, you will respawn at a random location in a random world that you have been to.
				</td>
				<td><span class="s5">Damage</span>
					You gain a means to hurt people and damage objects. This may take the form of a lightsaber, eyebeams, or just crazy chi powers. Choose something <em>now</em> Whatever it is, it can get you through a door in a second, and a bank vault in five, or kill one normal person per second in combat
				</td>
				<td colspan="2"><span class="s3">Porn Logic</span>
					<em>Upon Activation</em> Over the course of a three months, percentages between 0% to 50% you <em>Choose Now</em> increase the size of the local district's average sexual attributes. Size increases for people above average have sharply diminishing returns. You may apply it to the following between: Dicks, Semen, Balls, Tits, Hips, Ass, and Post-pregnancy Lactation. You, Men, and Women may have separate values, and <strong>New-Half</strong> affected may have separate values as well. In a 50% increase for example, 15 centimeter (6 inch) dicks become 22 centimeter (9 inch) dicks. All insertions perform normally as before change. Further adjustments require a month to take effect. <em>Upon deactivation</em> Society will revert back in a week.
				</td>
				<td><span class="s5">Lottery</span>
					When you take this power, throw a fair coin <em>now</em>. On heads, you gain 12 points. On tails, you gain nothing. In both cases, you must still pay for this power.

				<td><span class="s9">Time Travel</span>
					You gain the ability to time travel to any time in the past. You cannot time travel to the future because of the possibility of time paradoxes. This power requires the ring to be worn for at least a year, and the power can only be activated once per month (in your time).

					<em>During activation</em>, you do not need to sleep, always feel rested and are never tired due to lack of sleep. You can still sleep if you want to without consequences.

				<td class="child" colspan="2"><span class="s7">Eternal Youth</span>
					Choose a target age <em>now</em>. <em>Upon activation</em>, you are brought to this age at the rate at which you normally age. No matter whether you are younger or older.

				</td>
				<td><span class="s3">Polylingual</span>
					<em>During activation</em>, you are as fluent as can be in all existing languages, including natural languages, constructed languages and programming languages, written and oral.<br/><br/>Enjoy the Ithkuil.
				</td>
				<td class="child"><span class="s3">Pocket Space</span>
					You now constantly have access to a pocket dimension in which you can store about anything (including people) that you can physically carry, except yourself. Each ring with this power has its own pocket space. You have a different pocket space in each realm. Also, time is stopped in the pocket dimension when you’re not accessing it.
				</td>
				<td class="child" colspan="2"><span class="s7">Magical Realm</span>
					<em>During activation</em>, you can at any time travel to a parrallel low-fantasy medieval magical realm and back. At each travel from one realm to another, you will be teleported to the place nearest to where you left. The first time you arrive, you will be in a small village. Nothing other than you and your rings can travel between realms. That realm will forever be populated with humans with a mentality close enough to that of current earth. You will start as a total stranger to that society, but they can speak any language you can speak (Choose which one <em>now</em>). If this power deactivates, you are taken back to the normal world. Drawbacks that are carried out with technology in the normal world are carried out with magic in the magical realm.
				</td>

			<tr>
				<td colspan="2"><span class="s5">Ideal Match</span>
					<em>Upon Activation</em>, you meet a person that you must describe <em>now</em> (that description must still be somewhat realistic, and can include psychological features, such as being in love with you). However, <em>upon deactivation</em>, that person must leave you and not communicate with you. He/She has their own backstory, continues to live their life on their own and retains their memory between activations, but cannot communicate or meet you in any way when this power is deactivated. Challenging this may result in harm being caused to that person.
				</td>
				<td class="parent"><span class="s3">Quick Change</span>
					The change is now nine times faster. However, when you take the ring off, you start to age nine times faster for as long as you wore the ring.

					You can now change the target age at any time.

					Your pocket space is now shared between realms.
				</td>
				<td class="parent child"><span class="s5">Higher Up</span>
					<em>Upon activation</em>, you start with a fairly higher-up social position. You have a manor and are guaranteed a relatively stable source of income from your thirty serfs; but who knows how things may turn out. <em>Upon deactivation</em>, you are no longer recognized as the person who owns the manor or the serfs.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="child" colspan="4"><span class="s3">Metamorphosis</span>
					Choose <em>now</em> an entire physical appearance for your age and gender. You are limited to what would generally be found in people of your gender and age. For <strong>New Normal</strong>'s sex, you must adhere to their average height and weight bmi if specified. <em>During activation</em>, you transform into that form. You continue to age normally, and your age is carried through all your physical appearances. This is affected by <strong>Porn Logic</strong>
				</td>
				<td><span class="s5">Optivision</span>
					You can now see very far away, through walls and other thin surfaces, and in infrared. All can be activated and deactived on command.
				</td>
				<td class="parent" colspan="2"><span class="s7">Stargate</span>
					You can now, in each realm, build Stargate-sized gates that allow two-way communication and travel through the realms. Only the last stargate built in each realm works.
				</td>
				<td class="parent"><span class="s7">King in the North</span>
					You now start as the king of a small country. Grants a lot of power, but your position as king takes a lot of responsibility and work to stay unchallenged. Same rules as <strong>Higher Up</strong>.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="parent"><span class="s3">Shapeshifting</span>
					You can now re-choose your metamorphosis appearance up to once a day
				</td>
				<td class="parent"><span class="s3">Deception</span>
					<em>During activation</em>, everyone (except specific people which you can choose now) will think that your metamorphosis appearance is how you always looked. When looking at photographs of you, they will see your metamorphosis appearance instead.
				</td>
				<td class="parent" colspan="2"><span class="s3">Inhuman</span>
					You can now include inhuman features, including fantasy ones, as long as you remain of flesh and blood and somewhat humanoid. You can also specify another size as well (by a factor of three in both ways), but the change to your new size will be progressive (around 1m/3.28ft per day), including when this power deactivates
				</td>
				<td colspan="2"><span class="s3">New-half</span>
					Choose <em>now</em> between two sexes, and then their genitals. They can have a penis, a vagina, both, but not none. You may determine their proportions, average height and weight bmi, but only for those found in the sex you've chosen. They are not affected in any other way. <em>During activation</em>, 1/4th of your current district or <strong>Magical Realm</strong> is gradually changed into your choice, and limited to which sex you chose for 3 months. Drawbacks on all rings involving other people (indicated with a <img class="g_svg"/>) will now involve this new class of people, but only while this power is active. This can be purchased multiple times, but will be split among the same 1/4th unless it was the opposite sex. Upon <em>Deactivation</em> they revert back within a week.
				</td>
				<td class="child"><span class="s3">Empathy</span>
					You can know what other people are feeling
				</td>
				<td class="child"><span class="s3">Pro-choice</span>

			<tr>
				<td class="child"><span class="s5">Attracted</span>
					Drawbacks on this ring involving other people (indicated with a <img class="g_svg"/>) will now only involve people of the gender to which you are the most attracted. You can also take this power but keep both genders involved.
				</td>
				<td class="child"><span class="s7">Battlestation</span>
					<em>Upon activation</em>, the first computer you touch will have its processing speed and memory magically increased by a factor of 1024. This will disappear <em>upon deactivation</em>.
				</td>
				<td class="child"><span class="s3">Flying</span>
					<em>During activation</em>, you can fly. Your speed is similar to that of an eagle. If this power is suddenly interrupted while flying, you will slowly glide downwards until you land safely.
				</td>
				<td class="child" colspan="2"><span class="s5">Sharing is Caring</span>
					Rings crafted with this power can only be put on voluntarily by people other than you. Before being worn, the ring will explain to the person holding it the entirety of its effects. The ring cannot be put on someone who feels they’re being forced to put it on, must be in full capacity to make the decision to put on the ring. In a similar way, a person cannot be forced to keep wearing the ring. If the ring has the <strong>permanent</strong> drawback, that drawback only kicks in one month after the ring is put on.
				</td>
				<td class="child"><span class="s3">Welfare Leech</span>
					Every week while this power is activated, wherever you are, you will somehow gain the local equivalent of 1000 modern U.S. dollars, adjusted with inflation.
				</td>
				<td class="parent child"><span class="s5">Communication</span>
					You can communicate telepathically with other people.
				</td>
				<td class="parent" rowspan="2"><span class="s3">Pleasant Pregnancy</span>
					If you are capable of carrying a pregnancy then you will no longer experience periods, you will remain fertile during your normal times of the month but will not experience the difficulties and symptoms associated with them including bleeding and cramps. Additionally you will not experience any of the unpleasant symptoms of pregnancy and the aches and pains you experience whilst carrying your child and during childbirth are dulled to, at worst, the level of light muscle cramps. If you are capable of impregnating others you can grant this power to any partner carrying your child.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="parent"><span class="s3">Refined</span>
					Drawbacks on this ring involving other people (<img class="g_svg"/>) will now only involve people whom you find attractive. That criteria may loosen over time if the resulting amount of people is too small.
				</td>
				<td class="parent"><span class="s7">Halting Solution</span>
					That computer now gains the magical ability to determine if an arbitrary given program halts on an arbitrary given input. This takes O(n).
				</td>
				<td class="parent"><span class="s5">Noclip</span>
					You can now pass through solid matter. This can be activated or deactivated on command. If this power is suddenly interrupted, you will be able to stay noclipped until you find a place where you can re-materialize.
				</td>
				<td class="parent"><span class="s3">Sneaky</span>

				<td rowspan="4" colspan="4"><span class="s5">Ring of Domination</span>
					This power is very special: it allows you to gain points through being dominant rather than submissive.
					<br/><br/>
					This powers allows you to craft an associated slave ring. That slave ring comes with <strong>sharing is caring</strong> for free and will be linked to this ring. This ring doesn’t need to be crafted with a positive amount of credits anymore, but there must be enough drawbacks across both rings to compensate the costs of the powers across both rings. Both ring’s drawbacks apply as soon as they are worn; however, their powers only while both rings are being worn. <strong>Sharing is caring</strong> on the slave ring applies at all times.
					<br/>So the way to have gain powers without suffering drawbacks is to convince other people to submit themselves to drawbacks without rewards. <br/>A few notes:
					<br/>
					<br/>- Ring of domination can be taken multiple times on the same ring, and costs only one point if you already have it.
					<br/>- You can choose who is selected for all drawbacks involving other people (<img class="g_svg"/>), as long as you follow modifiers. The people you choose can be changed anytime. This can include you, but must include other people as well if the drawback requires multiple people simultaneously.
					<br/>- People you affect with any of your powers cannot wear slave rings.
					<br/>- The wearer of the master ring can force the wearer of the slave ring to take it off.
					<br/>- No power on the slave ring can be used on the last wearer of the master ring.
					<br/>- All punishments on the slave ring’s drawbacks apply to the wearer of the master ring when the slave does something they <em>mustn’t</em>, so you better keep your slaves in check. Those punishments can’t be <strong>physical reflex</strong> or <strong>conditioned</strong>.
					<br/>- All “<em>choose now</em>” choices are still made by the maker of the rings.
					<br/>- Slave rings <em>cannot</em> have the <strong>permanent</strong> drawback.
					<br/>- You always know where the slave ring is, and whether it is being worn.
					<br/>- You can change the jobs on the slave ring every few months unless <strong>fixed job</strong> is taken, but only the wearer of this ring can change them.
					<br/>- You can change the drawbacks on the slave ring every year as long as it’s not being worn or the wearer of the slave ring agrees to all changes when you do so. Doesn’t apply to jobs. There must still be enough drawbacks to compensate for the cost of the powers for both rings.
				</td>
				<td class="child selectable" colspan="4"><span>Ring of Devotion</span>
					This is the submissive counterpart to <strong>ring of domination</strong>: it allows yourself to devote yourself to someone. That person must agree to it. Obviously, cannot be taken on the same ring as <strong>ring of domination</strong>; however, different rings with those powers can be worn simultaneously.
					<br/><br/>
					Rings bearing this power (“rings of devotion”) allow you to craft one “ring of ownership”, which you will give to the person you wish to devote yourself to, your “master”. The ring of ownership can only bear powers, and the sum of all points in both rings must be non-negative. The ring of ownership comes with <strong>sharing is caring</strong> for free. Only when both rings are being worn at the same time do their effects affect their respective wearer. If only the ring of devotion is being worn, only its drawbacks apply.<br/>
					<br/>The following changes apply:
					<br/>- Cannot be taken on the same ring as <strong>sharing is caring</strong>.
					<br/>- For all drawbacks involving other people (<img class="g_svg"/>), your owner can choose who they involve. You owner can be one of them, but must include other people as well for drawbacks that require multiple people simultaneously.
					<br/>- If you take jobs and unless you take <strong>fixed job</strong>, you owner has full control over how you change jobs.
					<br/>- Your owner has great power over your drawbacks: the goddess is so impressed with your devotion that she has allowed your master to bend the rules of your drawbacks a little. They can influence frequencies, who is involved, what triggers punishments, and the sort. This is all up to your master, and can be in either way.
					<br/>- You are allowed to consult with the person you’re going to devote yourself to before you craft both rings; in fact, you may leave the crafting of those two rings entirely up to them.
					<br/>- As long as it makes sense to do so and there are drawbacks to compensate for cost of the powers on both rings, your master can change what drawbacks and punishments your ring has to their whim every year.
					<br/>- The wearer of the ring of ownership always knows where the ring of devotion is, as well as if the ring of devotion is being worn.

If you perform very badly on any of these jobs, the income from all sources other than that job will be blocked until you perform at least a bit well again.<br/><br/>The starting income of each job is the number of points it rewards multiplied by the local equivalent of a 1000 modern dollars per month, adjusted with inflation.

All (and only) requirements that require <strong>occupation</strong> count as jobs for the rings, except for <strong>local idol</strong> and <strong>fixed job</strong>.<br/><br/>In general, the jobs are a bit flexible: they’ll offer vacation if you work well enough, and will allow you to take a few days off every now and then. However, if you miss three consecutive days of work while this drawback is active, the punishment you chose for this drawback will trigger.

					The institute wishes to collect data regarding the effects of permanent pregnancy. To this end you will have a 'baby bot' placed inside your womb that will grow to match the size of a large child. This bot constantly releases small amounts of a sensitizing aphrodisiac, randomly vibrates throughout the day at either a gentle and reassuring buzz or an intensely orgasmic pace and rather energetically punches or kicks out its limbs. You will be unable to become conventionally pregnant whilst carrying the bot but it will replicate itself in a manner consistent with any oiptions you may have taken pertaining to <strong>Pro-Life</strong> if it comes into contact with fertile semen, growing over time to match the size of the original. The newly created bot(s) then induce birth so as to be collected by the institute and transfer all the data captured, but the original will remain. If you have <strong>Pro-Life</strong> you may use <strong>Pro-choice</strong> to abort the replication process. Whilst the bot will remain in place you can at your discretion disable it for 6 weeks once every 9 months.

		<table id="punishments">
			<tr>
				<td colspan="6"><h1>Punishments</h1>
					You have to choose exactly one punishment for each drawback with a <img class="p_svg"/> (you can choose the same one for multiple such drawbacks, even on the same ring). When you do something that the drawback says you <em>musn’t</em> do, the punishment will trigger.
					<br/><br/>
					Punishments with a <img class="l_svg"/> are leveled: they will go up one level with each trigger, and will reach their maximum at level 24. They only go down one level continuous month for which they haven’t been triggered.
					<br/><br/>
					Contrary to drawbacks, punishments persist even when the ring is taken off.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><span>Bimbofication</span>
					Each trigger of this punishment will go down the <strong>cross-dressing</strong> drawback and its sub-requirements, starting with <strong>cross-dressing</strong> itself. For each drawback triggered, you become less intelligent, equivalent of 10 points off of your IQ (to a minimum of 70).  One month after each trigger, one of these drawbacks will deactivate. If all drawbacks in this tree are taken, <strong>corruption</strong> activates instead. Cannot be taken with <strong>cross-dressing</strong>.
				</td>
				<td><span>Weakened</span>
					Your body becomes extremely weak. This slowly fades over a week; for the first hour, you will be unable to support your own weight.
				</td>
				<td colspan="3"><span>Corruption</span>
					You will crave for sex. Each times this punishment triggers, you will need to have sex two times a day, or you will experience very heavy symptoms of withdrawal. This lasts a month, but with each consecutive time this punishment triggers, the number of sex acts required per day stacks. Will not make you submissive as such, but you’ll be willing do to pretty much anything to get satisfied. Cannot be taken together with <strong>chastised</strong>. If your cravings are not satisfied, you will slowly start to become mad.
				</td>
				<td><span>Edgy</span>
					This punishment will cause you to edge continuously for three days. At the end of those three days, you get a ruined orgasm. If this punishment is the result of what would be an orgasm, that orgasm doesn’t occur (for example, with <strong>Pleasurer</strong>, if you can’t hold yourself for orgasm, this punishment kicks in just before your orgasm occurs).
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><span>Long Capture</span>
					An instance of <strong>bondage capture</strong> will occur with three to all sub-requirements, except up to two sub-requirements you can choose <em>now</em>. The following changes also apply:<br/>- The duration of the capture is now a whole continuous week.<br/>- Giving up has no effect.<br/>- You cannot break free or be broken free.<br/>
				</td>
				<td><span>No Good Feelings</span>
					You become unable to feel any kind of physical pleasure for a week. If this punishment triggers again during that time, you will start to be unable to feel joy as well.
				</td>
				<td colspan="2"><span>Stop Right There</span>
					Disables the <strong>move along</strong> and <strong>vanilla</strong> for two months: during that time, you can get in trouble with the authorities as you would normally. If this punishment triggers during that time, local authorities receive a vague anonymous tip about your activities, lying if you’ve done nothing wrong; too many may help them track you. The more that punishment is triggered, the more. When <strong>move along</strong> is re-enabled, you are freed from any kind of containment facility you were in. When <strong>vanilla</strong> is re-enabled, what you have done during the downtime will still be remembered as it was perceived then. If no such authority will arrest you, feared envoys of the goddess will.
				</td>
				<td><span>7mn in hell</span>
		Your body will start uncontrollably masturbating by itself vigorously for seven minutes. However, every time you orgasm, the time resets. If this punishment triggers too often, the duration will be longer.
				</td>
				<td><span>Physical Reflex</span>
					You simply can’t do something you <em>mustn’t</em> do. It is physically impossible for you; your body will move on its own if that’s what it takes. Can’t be taken for <strong>temptation</strong>. Sex that <strong>physical reflex</strong> forces you to take part in doesn’t count as you being raped.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><span>Extreme Sub</span>
					You become extremely submissive for a random duration between an hour and two weeks. Not only that, but you will strongly feel the need to obey, to the point where you will seek orders and ask to be ordered around. During that time, you will also have much reduced sense of shame.
				</td>
				<td><span>Down Time</span>
					You will be petrified for a random time between a few hours and two weeks. You body is entirely paused, with the exception of your mind and senses.
				</td>
				<td colspan="2"><span>Conditioned</span>
					Requires <strong>collar</strong>. For everything that you <em>mustn’t</em> do: you will feel an uncomfortable electric tingling when you consider doing it, a somewhat intense electrical pain when you plan on doing it, and a very painful electrical shock when you finally do it. Will keep you on the right track and make you work to satisfy the drawbacks. Overrides <strong>Painless</strong> and <strong>Masochism</strong>.
				</td>
				<td><span>Cursed</span>
					Something bad will happen to someone you care about. This can range from a twisted ankle to a dead pet, a robbery, a non-permanent injury, or a relationship breakup. If there is no one you care about, this will happen to you.
				</td>
				<td><span>Fined</span>
					You will be fined a certain sum of money by the goddess. This will always be an amount you can barely afford, so you’ll have to collect more. The more you are indebted to her, the more she will try to make your life miserable.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><span>Livestock</span>
					Requires <strong>Lactation</strong>, <strong>Pearl Coating</strong>, or <strong>Milking</strong>.  Someone, in the next 24 hours, will blindfold you, and throw you into an unmarked van where you will be kept and milked for a couple days.   Afterwards, you will be blindfolded and released on a random highway
				</td>
				<td><span>Busy</span>
					This punishment greatly increases the frequency or duration of your drawbacks, usually by a factor of two. Can only be taken if you have at least three drawbacks to which this would be applicable.
				</td>
				<td><span>All Dolled Up</span>
					You are transformed into an inflatable sex doll.  You are used and passed between people, likely deflated between uses.  You cannot move or speak but are fully aware and have full senses.  You revert to normal after 24 hours and cannot be injured in the process.
				</td>
				<td colspan="2"><span>Berry</span>
					Over the course of an hour after triggering, your body swells and turns blue.  Your body ends up roughly spherical and immobile.  Within 2 hours, you will be kidnapped by a group of orange-skinned midgets, blindfolded, and taken to a factory where the excess fluid is "juiced" out of your breasts and sex organs.   This takes about 24 hours and is fairly uncomfortable.  They will then release you somewhere close to where they took you from.  During the abduction they will also sing a short jingle about your moral failing.
				</td>
				<td><span>Smashing</span>
					For three days you are forcibly <strong>Shrunken</strong>, and become malleable. Crushing you flat, stretching you, or molding you into lingerie is extremely satisfying for aggressors. During free-time not devoted to <em>Jobs, Drawbacks</em> will be spent being squished for the entirety of that time by those intimately closest to you.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td colspan="3"><span>Tentacle Hell</span>
					Disables <b>Flight</b>, <b>Noclip</b> and <b>Teleport</b> whilst in effect. Also prevents the removal of rings and usage or creation of a <b>Stargate</b>.
Once triggered, this punishment will cause a car sized tentacle monster to manifest in a neighboring district that will begin to immediately hunt you down. It will ignore other people and they will ignore it as it will cause no damage or disruption to the world as it hunts you, it will even slither along walls, leap across rooftops and swim through rivers to avoid inconveniencing other people. This monster can move about as fast as a galloping horse, is malleable enough to somehow squeeze through soda can sized holes and strong enough to completey crush vault doors in seconds. If you can avoid capture for 24 hours the punishment ends and the monster dissapears. But in the far more likely event that it captures you, it will devour you for 24 hours and trap you in an endlessly orgasming tentacle hell, penetrating every orifice whilst whipping and slapping your body with its multitude of uniquely shaped tentacles. Your other drawbacks will be disabled for 24 hours once captured, but whilst the beast hunts you they shall still take effect and any additional punishments you would incur from not fulfilling any of these drawbacks are replaced by extending your imprisonment by 6 hours, if you are captured your other drawbacks may activate more frequently to compensate for lost time.
				</td>
				<td colspan="3"><span>Spacetime Correctional Officer Captain Zentai!</span>
					After triggering this punishment the universe will instantly become frozen in time and you will be unable to move your body of your own volition. After 20 minutes to 1 hour a mysterious figure clad in a brightly coloured zentai suit and ridiculous helmet will appear before you, announcing themself with intense passion and dynamic posing as 'Captain Zentai Spacetime Correctional Officer and punisher of miscreants'! They will be of a gender that is compatible with your genitals at the time, or if you have <b>Futanari</b> be a random gender with different genital configurations each time. After formally introducing themselves they will immediately reveal their genitals and get to work correcting your misdemeanor via 48 hours of continuous and energetic rape. The entire time they will loudly boast about serving justice and belittle you as a despicable villain in the making, encouraging you to self assess during your rape and correct whatever behaviour lead to this. If you are a repeat offender they will admonish you even more and give your butt a thorough spanking as they deliver justice to your genitals. You will have full sensations of what happens to you and, whilst you cannot move yourself, Captain Zentai can move and pose you in whatever position they want. Generally they will keep you within the location where you triggered this punishment. After having served justice for the mandated 48 hours Captain Zentai will bid you adieu with another bout of dynamic posing and, after leaving you in an extremely comprimising pose, unfreeze the universe when they leave your line of sight. You will be unfrozen 10 minutes later, during which time you will re-experience every orgasm you had during the 48 hour period whilst being mocked and laughed at by everyone surrounding you.

You are now always considered to be in your fertile period and as such there will always be a chance of you becoming pregnant at any time of the month. Chemical contraception now has a 1/2 failure chance and physical contraceptives such as condoms will break 1/3 of the time. Additionally your awareness of a successful impregnation will change to a single alert signal delivered at a random time between 2 and 60 minutes after fertilization that you will only perceive and recognise if you are conscious and lucid at the time. You will have 5 minutes from the time this alert is sent, regardless of whether you perceived it, to make your decision to abort with <strong>pro-choice</strong> or not, should you choose to you will have to empty your mind and focus on consciously invoking the punishment attached to this drawback. After this 5 minute window if you did not, or were unable to, invoke your punishment or instantly if you decide to carry the pregnancy you will experience an immediate and intense full-body orgasm as congratulations for your successful impregnation. After using <strong>pro-choice</strong> to abort a pregnancy you will immediately become fertile again but all foreign semen within your body at the time will become sterile and unable to impregnate you.
<td class="parent"><span class="a2">Hyper Preg<img class="f_svg"/><img class="t_svg"/></span>
When pregnant, you become massive. You gestate for 12 months normally and your children are born as developed as a typical 2 year old, even with twins or by Multiple Birth. Your body is modified to handle the extra weight, but not the balance. Good luck with doors.
</td>
<td class="parent"><span class="a1">Efficient Gestation<img class="f_svg"/><img class="t_svg"/></span>
You will fully and safely gestate and birth your offspring in half the normal time. If taken with <strong>Hyper Preg</strong> gestation will take 9 months.
