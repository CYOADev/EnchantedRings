					<h1>Enchante/d/ Rings CYOA</h1>
					<p>
						The goddess of all things lewd has granted you the power to craft magical rings. When worn, they will provide magical powers; but in exchange, they will carry some drawbacks for the entertainment of the goddess. You must craft all rings right now, but can read the whole document before doing anything.
					</p>
					<p>
						Each ring you make is very thin and easy to put on. However, some may only come off under certain conditions. By default, only you can wear the rings. If you lose them, you can make them come back to you. They cannot be destroyed.
					<p>
						If you take any drawback that involves permanent use of some other jewelry or equipment that is connected to the body, the ring may be shaped as the device itself.
					</p>
					<hr/>
					<p>
						For each ring, you can buy any amount of powers, drawbacks; in any order you want. Powers will take points, drawbacks will give you points. All points are specific to that ring, and the total sum of points of each ring must be zero or positive.
					</p>
					<p>
						The rings you make are crafted in order. The first one you craft starts with 0 points, the second one starts with —2 points, the third with —4 points, and so on. This does not apply to slave rings and rings of ownership.
					</p>
					<p>
						Some effects can’t be taken together: they can’t be applied to the same ring. They may be applied to different rings, but these rings cannot then be worn together. In general, two effects from two different rings count as taken together for as long as they’re both active if the two rings are worn together.
					</p>
					<p>
						Unless otherwise specified, each effect cannot be taken more than once per ring.
					</p>
					<p>
						Multiple rings can be worn together only if they have together at least as much unused points as the sum of their common drawbacks minus the sum of their common non-stackable powers; for example, if two rings have only three +3 drawbacks and a —5 non-stackable power in common, they must have together at least 4 left over points to be worn together. Their common powers and drawbacks don’t stack (except for powers that can be taken multiple times); drawbacks and punishments that override powers override them over all active powers, not just the powers from their own ring.
					<p>
						The goddess wants you to entertain her, so she will keep random events from happening at times that would put you in danger.
					</p>
					<hr/>
					<p>
						“The ring” or “this ring” refers to the ring on which the effect is applied.
					</p>
					<p>
						Choices written as “choose <em>now</em>” must be made when the ring is crafted. A different choice may be made each time an effect is applied on a ring. Choices written as “choose <em>upon activation</em>” must be made when the ring is put on.
					</p>
					<p>
						When a ring is put on, its drawbacks and punishments activate immediately, but <b>a ring's powers activate only after having being worn for a week</b> <em>(startup duration)</em>. Also, when the ring is taken off, its powers deactivate immediately, but <b>its drawbacks and punishments stay active for a full week after the ring is taken off</b> <em>(cooldown duration)</em>. The ring can be taken off during the startup duration, but its powers would not have been activated. The ring cannot be put back on until its cooldown duration has finished. This also applies to rings with the same drawback and other rings conflicting with this one.
					</p>
					<hr/>
					<p>
						No power can be used to escape or avoid the effect of a drawback or punishment, and effects with obvious contradictions cannot be taken together. Some drawbacks may, directly or indirectly, cause you to be abused; in those cases, your abuser will generally try to take you somewhere at least a little private. A ring does not count as being worn if the wearer is dead. Finally, you are forced to have the following six powers permanently for free.
					</p>

However, you can only stop their minds for as much time as you’ve worn the ring since you last used this power (for example, you can stop their minds for up to a week if you’ve worn the ring for a week without using the power, or if you've worn the ring for a week since you’ve last used this power).

You will start as a total stranger to that society, but they can speak any language you can speak (Choose which on <em>now</em>). If this power deactivates, you are taken back to the normal world.

					Any excess points you have on this ring or combination of rings including this one, may be retained at one excess = one stored point/day.  You may then use these stored points to gain the effect of powers or mitigate drawbacks.
					<br>Stored points are spent to produce an effect like <strong>Versatile</strong> for one week, but you can choose higher cost powers or drawbacks.  You may have only one power gain or drawback mitigated at a time with this power, this is in addition to the one available by <strong>Versatile</strong>.  The costs are 14 x base cost for powers and 21 x base return for drawbacks.  If you qualify for a power only because of a use of <strong>Versatile</strong> you lose the effect immediately if required power is replaced.  Points only store if they are available for 24 hours.

				<td class="p" colspan="4" rowspan="4"><span class="m">Ring of Domination</span>
					This power is very special: it allows you to gain points through being dominant rather than submissive.
					<br/><br/>
					This powers allows you to craft an associated slave ring. That slave ring comes with <strong>sharing is caring</strong> for free and will be linked to this ring. This ring doesn’t need to be crafted with a positive amount of credits anymore, but there must be enough drawbacks across both rings to compensate the costs of the powers across both rings. Both ring’s drawbacks apply as soon as they are worn; however, their powers only while both rings are being worn. <strong>Sharing is caring</strong> on the slave ring applies at all times.
					<br/>So the way to have gain powers without suffering drawbacks is to convince other people to submit themselves to drawbacks without rewards. <br/>A few notes:
					<br/>
					<br/>- Ring of domination can be taken multiple times on the same ring, and costs only one point if you already have it.
					<br/>- You can choose who is selected for all drawbacks involving other people (<img class="na g_svg"/>), as long as you follow modifiers. The people you choose can be changed anytime. This can include you, but must include other people as well if the drawback requires multiple people simultaneously.
					<br/>- People you affect with any of your powers cannot wear slave rings.
					<br/>- The wearer of the master ring can force the wearer of the slave ring to take it off.
					<br/>- No power on the slave ring can be used on the last wearer of the master ring.
					<br/>- All punishments on the slave ring’s drawbacks apply to the wearer of the master ring when the slave does something they <em>mustn’t</em>, so you better keep your slaves in check. Those punishments can’t be <strong>physical reflex</strong> or <strong>conditioned</strong>.
					<br/>- All “<em>choose now</em>” choices are still made by the maker of the rings.
					<br/>- Slave rings <em>cannot</em> have the <strong>permanent</strong> drawback.
					<br/>- You always know where the slave ring is, and whether it is being worn.
					<br/>- You can change the jobs on the slave ring every few months unless <strong>fixed job</strong> is taken, but only the wearer of this ring can change them.
					<br/>- You can change the drawbacks on the slave ring every year as long as it’s not being worn or the wearer of the slave ring agrees to all changes when you do so. Doesn’t apply to jobs. There must still be enough drawbacks to compensate for the cost of the powers for both rings.
				</td>
				<td class="p do" colspan="4"><span>Ring of Devotion</span>
					This is the submissive counterpart to <strong>ring of domination</strong>: it allows yourself to devote yourself to someone. That person must agree to it. Obviously, cannot be taken on the same ring as <strong>ring of domination</strong>; however, different rings with those powers can be worn simultaneously.
					<br/><br/>
					Rings bearing this power (“rings of devotion”) allow you to craft one “ring of ownership”, which you will give to the person you wish to devote yourself to, your “master”. The ring of ownership can only bear powers, and the sum of all points in both rings must be non-negative. The ring of ownership comes with <strong>sharing is caring</strong> for free. Only when both rings are being worn at the same time do their effects affect their respective wearer. If only the ring of devotion is being worn, only its drawbacks apply.<br/>
					<br/>The following changes apply:
					<br/>- Cannot be taken on the same ring as <strong>sharing is caring</strong>.
					<br/>- For all drawbacks involving other people (<img class="na g_svg"/>), your owner can choose who they involve. You owner can be one of them, but must include other people as well for drawbacks that require multiple people simultaneously.
					<br/>- If you take jobs and unless you take <strong>fixed job</strong>, you owner has full control over how you change jobs.
					<br/>- Your owner has great power over your drawbacks: the goddess is so impressed with your devotion that she has allowed your master to bend the rules of your drawbacks a little. They can influence frequencies, who is involved, what triggers punishments, and the sort. This is all up to your master, and can be in either way.
					<br/>- You are allowed to consult with the person you’re going to devote yourself to before you craft both rings; in fact, you may leave the crafting of those two rings entirely up to them.
					<br/>- As long as it makes sense to do so and there are drawbacks to compensate for cost of the powers on both rings, your master can change what drawbacks and punishments your ring has to their whim every year.
					<br/>- The wearer of the ring of ownership always knows where the ring of devotion is, as well as if the ring of devotion is being worn.

If you perform very badly on any of these jobs, the income from all sources other than that job will be blocked until you perform at least a bit well again.<br/><br/>The starting income of each job is the number of points it rewards multiplied by the local equivalent of a 1000 modern dollars per month, adjusted with inflation. This can go up if you work well, but also down if you do a shit job. The number of days each job takes is written in brackets for each job. All (and only) requirements that require <strong>occupation</strong> count as jobs for the rings, except for <strong>local idol</strong> and <strong>fixed job</strong>.<br/><br/>In general, the jobs are a bit flexible: they’ll offer vacation if you work well enough, and will allow you to take a few days off every now and then. However, if you miss three consecutive days of work while this drawback is active, the punishment you chose for this drawback will trigger. For this reason, it is recommended to keep your jobs on a ring you can take off if you ever want to take a long vacation or completely drop a job.

					Something bad will happen to someone you care about. This can range from a twisted ankle to a dead pet, a robbery, a non-permanent injury, or a relationship breakup. If there is no one you care about, this will happen to you.
				</td>
				<td class="n"><span>Fined</span>
					You will be fined a certain sum of money by the goddess. This will always be an amount you can barely afford, so you’ll have to collect more. The more you are indebted to her, the more she will try to make your life miserable.

				Requires <strong>Lactation</strong>, <strong>High Output</strong>, or <strong>Milking</strong>.  Someone, in the next 24 hours, will blindfold you, and throw you into an unmarked van where you will be kept and milked for a couple days.   Afterwards, you will be blindfolded and released on a random highway

			<td class="n"><span>Busy</span>
				This punishment greatly increases the frequency or duration of your drawbacks, usually by a factor of two. Can only be taken if you have at least three drawbacks to which this would be applicable.
			</td>
			<td class="n"><span>All Dolled Up</span>
				You are transformed into an inflatable sex doll.  You are used and passed between people, likely deflated between uses.  You cannot move or speak but are fully aware and have full senses.  You revert to normal after 24 hours and cannot be injured in the process.

			<td colspan="2" class="n"><span>Berry</span>
				Over the course of an hour after triggering, your body swells and turns blue.  Your body ends up roughly spherical and immobile.  Within 2 hours, you will be kidnapped by a group of orange-skinned midgets, blindfolded, and taken to a factory where the excess fluid is "juiced" out of your breasts and sex organs.   This takes about 24 hours and is fairly uncomfortable.  They will then release you somewhere close to where they took you from.  During the abduction they will also sing a short jingle about your moral failing.
			</td>
			<td colspan="1" class="n"><span>Smashing</span>
				For a week you are forcibly <strong>Shrunken</strong>, and become malleable, crushing you flat, stretching you, or molding you into lingerie is extremely satisfying for aggressors. During free-time not devoted to <em>Jobs, Drawbacks</em> will be spent being squished for the entirety of that time by those intimately closest to you.

					<b>Change Log 1.00->1.01:</b><br/>
						&nbsp;Added the points system back<br/>
						&nbsp;Cleaned up some code<br/>
					<b>Change Log 1.01->1.02: 2019-02-06</b><br/>
						&nbsp;/u/Vintrion added a lot of stuff, detailed notes attached below<br/>
					<b>Roadmap:</b><br/>
						&nbsp;Format the blocks so the CYOA is more condensed<br/>
						&nbsp;Cleaning up the javascript code some more because it is just a mess<br/>
						&nbsp;Cleaning up the html classes for more consistency<br/>
						&nbsp;Possibly let someone else do this project because I can contribute nothing other than the technical side of this cyoa (being on a website and such)<br/>
						&nbsp;Attempt to do automatic formatting so adding new blocks won't be such a pain in the butt<br/>
						&nbsp;Accept suggestions from different forums I guess?<br/>
					<b>Vintri Notes:</b><br/>
						&nbsp;I've made a monster. Major changes only from this point on: Removed Fuck Machine/Pee Orgasm, changed Ass-Matic to general drawback, fucked with order of everything and standardized to Metric <br/>
						&nbsp;Added a lot of drawbacks that are mostly for convenience, and nerfed the fuck out of other things that are potentially too convenient for quick fucks, or only exist to separate you from society without real demerits<br/>
						&nbsp;It should be self-explanatory but Waste when mentioned refers to the decomposed mass found in bowels, and when removed human biology will; though magically, convert it to a harmless lubricant.
