					<h1>Enchante/d/ Rings CYOA</h1>
					<p>
						The goddess of all things lewd has granted you the power to craft magical rings. When worn, they will provide magical powers; but in exchange, they will carry some drawbacks for the entertainment of the goddess. You must craft all rings right now, but can read the whole document before doing anything.
					</p>
					<p>
						Each ring you make is very thin and easy to put on. However, some may only come off under certain conditions. By default, only you can wear the rings. If you lose them, you can make them come back to you. They cannot be destroyed.
          <p>
          If you take any drawback that involves permanent use of some other jewelry or equipment that is connected to the body, the ring may be shaped as the device itself.
            
					</p>
					<hr/>
					<p>
						For each ring, you can buy any amount of powers, drawbacks; in any order you want. Powers will take points, drawbacks will give you points. All points are specific to that ring, and the total sum of points of each ring must be zero or positive.
					</p>
					<p>
						The rings you make are crafted in order. The first one you craft starts with 0 points, the second one starts with —2 points, the third with —4 points, and so on. This does not apply to slave rings and rings of ownership.
					</p>
					<p>
						Some effects can’t be taken together: they can’t be applied to the same ring. They may be applied to different rings, but these rings cannot then be worn together. In general, two effects from two different rings count as taken together for as long as they’re both active if the two rings are worn together.
					</p>
					<p>
						Unless otherwise specified, each effect cannot be taken more than once per ring.
					</p>
					<p>
						Multiple rings can be worn together only if they have together at least as much unused points as the sum of their common drawbacks minus the sum of their common non-stackable powers; for example, if two rings have only three +3 drawbacks and a —5 non-stackable power in common, they must have together at least 4 left over points to be worn together. Their common powers and drawbacks don’t stack (except for powers that can be taken multiple times); drawbacks and punishments that override powers override them over all active powers, not just the powers from their own ring.
					<p>
						The goddess wants you to entertain her, so she will keep random events from happening at times that would put you in danger.
					</p>
					<hr/>
					<p>
						“The ring” or “this ring” refers to the ring on which the effect is applied.
					</p>
					<p>
						Choices written as “choose <em>now</em>” or "<em>now</em> must be made when the ring is crafted. A different choice may be made each time an effect is applied on a ring. Choices written as “choose <em>upon activation</em>” must be made when the ring is put on.
					</p>
					<hr/>
					<p>
						No power can be used to escape or avoid the effect of a drawback or punishment, and effects with obvious contradictions cannot be taken together. Some drawbacks may, directly or indirectly, cause you to be abused; in those cases, your abuser will generally try to take you somewhere at least a little private. A ring does not count as being worn if the wearer is dead.
					</p>
          <hr/>
					<p>
          Many elements will have a particular symbol in the upper left corner as a short hand for a more complicated issue or interactions.  Their meanings as follows:<br>
          <img class="na m_svg"/>/<img class="na f_svg"/> indicates that the element requires a penis/vagina to take, this is not explicitly male or female sex (ie, a futanari/herm will satisfy both).<br>
          <img class="na u_svg"/> indicates that a drawback requires a consequent population to be around. <strong>Important</strong>: if you’re not in an urban area or live extremely reclusively while wearing a ring with such drawbacks, the powers will slowly fade (or new drawbacks will appear). They disappear completely after a few months, and take a few months (with the ring being worn) to come back.<br/>
          <img class="na p_svg"/> indicates that a drawback uses the word <em>must</em>. <strong>Important</strong>: a punishment has to be selected for each such drawback.<br/>
					<img class="na g_svg"/> indicates that a drawback may involve arbitrary people. By default, this will only include adults outside of your family. Some drawbacks and powers can affect who is involved.<br/>
					<img class="na t_svg"/> indicates that the element is a transformation effect.  All transformation effects are physical/non-magic body changes.  For each that you have you may choose <em>now</em> the time they take to change between instant and one hour. <br>
          <img class="na w_svg"/> indicates that the element has a world building function, generating or modifying a world that is not your own.  Your actions are capable of altering these worlds for better or worse and no point cost is changed retroactively.  Your ability to change things may be limited in the text.<br>
          For powers, ambiguous ideas within the power will tend to reflect your desires and negative changes you may impart on the world are likely to sort themselves out in time.  For punishments, ambiguous points will tend to reflect your doubts and fears and over time similar problems will reappear if you manage to solve one. <br>
          Points from drawbacks and corruptions may fade if the associated world is avoided. <br>
          <img class="na s_svg"/> indicates that the element changes your social standing or social class.  Although you can effect this for better or worse, they will follow similar logic in restoring benefits of powers and problems of drawbacks as the world building ones. 
          <br>If you have access to other realities from powers on the same ring, social standing powers (and most corruptions and drawbacks) will function only in the world on that ring.  Points from drawbacks and corruptions that are world specific will fade if avoided, just like the world building ones.<br>
          <img class="na aa_svg"/>/<img class="na as_svg"/> indicates that the element establishes an authority figure/grants an authority figure new powers.  An authority figure will never face social or legal backlash for their orders or control, society will ignore any obvious illegality or immorality. This functions as if the authority has both <strong>Move Along</strong> and <strong>Vanilla</strong>. For all drawbacks, the mentioned person(s) will be(include) an authority whenever possible.<br>
          <img class="na b_svg"/> indicates that the element causes alterations to your mind or personality.  This prevents you from resisting its effect as you will believe the behavior from it is your normal.  You will not be aware there is or was any such change while the ring is <em>activated</em>.<br>
          </p>
          <hr/>
          <p>
          Making your first ring grants the following seven benefits at no cost:

You can then stop the time of their minds; everything will continue on normally, but their mind will just skip everything until you resume time (the ring cannot be taken off during this time). However, you can only stop their minds for as much time as you’ve worn the ring since you last used this power (for example, you can stop their minds for up to a week if you’ve worn the ring for a week without using the power, or if you've worn the ring for a week since you’ve last used this power).

Additionally you will not experience any of the unpleasant symptoms of pregnancy and the aches and pains you experience whilst carrying your child and during childbirth are dulled to, at worst, the level of light muscle cramps. If you are capable of impregnating others you can grant this power to any partner carrying your child.
				</td>
        			<td class="do p"><span class="t">Welfare Leech</span>
					Every week while this power is activated, wherever you are, you will somehow gain the local equivalent of 1000 modern U.S. dollars, adjusted with inflation.

					This power is very special: it allows you to gain points through being dominant rather than submissive.
					<br/><br/>
					This powers allows you to craft an associated slave ring. That slave ring comes with <strong>sharing is caring</strong> for free and will be linked to this ring. This ring doesn’t need to be crafted with a positive amount of credits anymore, but there must be enough drawbacks across both rings to compensate the costs of the powers across both rings. Both ring’s drawbacks apply as soon as they are worn; however, their powers only while both rings are being worn. <strong>Sharing is caring</strong> on the slave ring applies at all times.
					<br/>So the way to have gain powers without suffering drawbacks is to convince other people to submit themselves to drawbacks without rewards. <br/>A few notes:
					<br/>
					<br/>- Ring of domination can be taken multiple times on the same ring, and costs only one point if you already have it.
					<br/>- You are considered an authority figure to the wearer of the slave ring, effecting associated drawbacks (indicated with <img class="na as_svg"/>).
          <br/>- You can choose who is selected for all drawbacks involving other people (<img class="na g_svg"/>), as long as you follow modifiers. The people you choose can be changed anytime. This can include you, but must include other people as well if the drawback requires multiple people simultaneously.
					<br/>- People you affect with any of your powers cannot wear slave rings.
					<!--<br/>- All powers on the slave ring (except <strong>sharing is caring</strong>) can be individually turned off by the current wearer of the master ring while the ring isn’t being worn.-->
					<br/>- The wearer of the master ring can force the wearer of the slave ring to take it off.
					<br/>- No power on the slave ring can be used on the last wearer of the master ring.
					<br/>- All punishments on the slave ring’s drawbacks apply to the wearer of the master ring when the slave does something they <em>mustn’t</em>, so you better keep your slaves in check. Those punishments can’t be <strong>physical reflex</strong> or <strong>conditioned</strong>.
					<br/>- All “<em>choose now</em>” choices are still made by the maker of the rings.
					<br/>- Slave rings <em>cannot</em> have the <strong>permanent</strong> drawback.
					<br/>- You always know where the slave ring is, and whether it is being worn.
					<br/>- You can change the jobs on the slave ring every few months, but only the wearer of this ring can change them.
					<br/>- You can change the drawbacks on the slave ring every year as long as it’s not being worn or the wearer of the slave ring agrees to all changes when you do so. Doesn’t apply to jobs. There must still be enough drawbacks to compensate for the cost of the powers for both rings.

				<td aria-controls=""class="p do" colspan="4"><span>Ring of Devotion<img class="aa_svg"/></span>
					This is the submissive counterpart to <strong>ring of domination</strong>: it allows yourself to devote yourself to someone. That person must agree to it. Obviously, cannot be taken on the same ring as <strong>ring of domination</strong>; however, different rings with those powers can be worn simultaneously.
					<br/><br/>
					Rings bearing this power (“rings of devotion”) allow you to craft one “ring of ownership”, which you will give to the person you wish to devote yourself to, your “master”. The ring of ownership can only bear powers, and the sum of all points in both rings must be non-negative. The ring of ownership comes with <strong>sharing is caring</strong> for free. Only when both rings are being worn at the same time do their effects affect their respective wearer. If only the ring of devotion is being worn, only its drawbacks apply.<br/>
					<br/>The following changes apply:
					<br/>- Cannot be taken on the same ring as <strong>sharing is caring</strong>.
          <br/>- Th wearer of the ring of ownership is considered an authority figure to you, effecting associated drawbacks (indicated with <img class="na as_svg"/>).
					<br/>- For all drawbacks involving other people (<img class="na g_svg"/>), your owner can choose who they involve. You owner can be one of them, but must include other people as well for drawbacks that require multiple people simultaneously.
					<br/>- If you take <strong>Occupation</strong>, your owner has full control over how you change jobs.
					<br/>- Your owner has great power over your drawbacks: the goddess is so impressed with your devotion that she has allowed your master to bend the rules of your drawbacks a little. They can influence frequencies, who is involved, what triggers punishments, and the sort. This is all up to your master, and can be in either way.
					<br/>- You are allowed to consult with the person you’re going to devote yourself to before you craft both rings; in fact, you may leave the crafting of those two rings entirely up to them.
					<br/>- As long as it makes sense to do so and there are drawbacks to compensate for cost of the powers on both rings, your master can change what drawbacks and punishments your ring has to their whim every year.
					<br/>- The wearer of the ring of ownership always knows where the ring of devotion is, as well as if the ring of devotion is being worn.

        Roll a random number between 0 and <b style="font-weight:normal" id="maxroll"></b>. Note: you can use http://random.org/integers to generate numbers.
        <br/><br/>Locate the associated drawback using the gray number below the number of points obtained. Then, choose <em>now</em> between the following options:
        <br/><br/>1. Accept and take that drawback for this ring, if you can. If you can’t because of requirements, take one of its (direct or indirect) requirements you can take. If you can’t because it’s already taken, take one drawback that (directly or indirectly) requires it and that you can take. If you still can’t, reroll for free. Whatever drawback you take that way, the amount of points it gives you is tripled.
        <br/><br/>2. Refuse that drawback and reroll. You lose 4 — (the reward of the most rewarding drawback you could have taken by going through option <strong>1</strong>) points.
        <br/><br/>If you can reassign drawback points with <strong>ring of devotion</strong> and <strong>ring of domination</strong>, you must reassign all points they made you gain through random rolling, including the possible <strong>full random</strong> bonus.

This bot constantly releases small amounts of a sensitizing aphrodisiac, randomly vibrates throughout the day at either a gentle and reassuring buzz or an intensely orgasmic pace and rather energetically punches or kicks out its limbs. You will be unable to become conventionally pregnant whilst carrying the bot but it will replicate itself in a manner consistent with any oiptions you may have taken pertaining to <strong>Pro-Life</strong> if it comes into contact with fertile semen, growing over time to match the size of the original. The newly created bot(s) then induce birth so as to be collected by the institute and transfer all the data captured, but the original will remain. If you have <strong>Pro-Life</strong> you may use <strong>Pro-choice</strong> to abort the replication process. Whilst the bot will remain in place you can at your discretion disable it for 6 weeks once every 9 months.

It will ignore other people and they will ignore it as it will cause no damage or disruption to the world as it hunts you, it will even slither along walls, leap across rooftops and swim through rivers to avoid inconveniencing other people. This monster can move about as fast as a galloping horse, is malleable enough to somehow squeeze through soda can sized holes and strong enough to completey crush vault doors in seconds. If you can avoid capture for 24 hours the punishment ends and the monster dissapears. But in the far more likely event that it captures you, it will devour you for 24 hours and trap you in an endlessly orgasming tentacle hell, penetrating every orifice whilst whipping and slapping your body with its multitude of uniquely shaped tentacles. Your other drawbacks will be disabled for 24 hours once captured, but whilst the beast hunts you they shall still take effect and any additional punishments you would incur from not fulfilling any of these drawbacks are replaced by extending your imprisonment by 6 hours, if you are captured your other drawbacks may activate more frequently to compensate for lost time.

They will be of a gender that is compatible with your genitals at the time, or if you have <strong>Futanari</strong> be a random gender with different genital configurations each time. After formally introducing themselves they will immediately reveal their genitals and get to work correcting your misdemeanor via 48 hours of continuous and energetic rape. The entire time they will loudly boast about serving justice and belittle you as a despicable villain in the making, encouraging you to self assess during your rape and correct whatever behaviour lead to this. If you are a repeat offender they will admonish you even more and give your butt a thorough spanking as they deliver justice to your genitals. You will have full sensations of what happens to you and, whilst you cannot move yourself, <strong>Captain Zentai</strong> can move and pose you in whatever position they want. Generally they will keep you within the location where you triggered this punishment. After having served justice for the mandated 48 hours <strong>Captain Zentai</strong> will bid you adieu with another bout of dynamic posing and, after leaving you in an extremely comprimising pose, unfreeze the universe when they leave your line of sight. You will be unfrozen 10 minutes later, during which time you will re-experience every orgasm you had during the 48 hour period whilst being mocked and laughed at by everyone surrounding you.
